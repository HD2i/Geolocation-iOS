## Features

- [x] Swift implementation of [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) functionality :zap:
- [x] Interaction with remote node via JSON RPC :thought_balloon:
- [x] Smart-contract ABI parsing :book:
- [x] ABI deconding (V2 is supported with return of structures from public functions. Part of 0.4.22 Solidity compiler)
- [x] RLP encoding
- [x] Interactions (read/write to Smart contracts) :arrows_counterclockwise:
- [x] Local keystore management (`geth` compatible)
- [x] Batched requests in concurrent mode
- [x] Literally following the standards:
	- [x] [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/feature/readmeImprovement/bip-0032.mediawiki) HD Wallets: Deterministic Wallet
	- [x] [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/feature/readmeImprovement/bip-0039.mediawiki) (Seed phrases)
	- [x] [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/feature/readmeImprovement/bip-0044.mediawiki) (Key generation prefixes)
	- [x] [EIP-155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/feature/readmeImprovement/EIPS/eip-155.md) (Replay attacks protection) *enforced!*
- [x] Comprehensive Unit and Integration Test Coverage
- [x] [Complete Documentation](https://web3swift.github.io/web3swift)

## Design Decisions

- Not every JSON RPC function is exposed yet, and priority is given to the ones required for mobile devices
- Functionality was focused on serializing and signing transactions locally on the device to send raw transactions to Ethereum network
- Requirements for password input on every transaction are indeed a design decision. Interface designers can save user passwords with the user's consent
- Public function for private key export is exposed for user convenience but marked as UNSAFE_ :) Normal workflow takes care of EIP155 compatibility and proper clearing of private key data from memory

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+ / macOS 10.11+
- Xcode 9.0+
- Swift 4.1+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate web3swift into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'web3swift'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate web3swift into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "matterinc/web3swift" "carthage"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `web3swift.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Example Project

You can try lib by running the example project:

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/matterinc/web3swift.git`
- Move to the repo: `cd web3swift/Example/web3swiftExample`
- Install Dependencies: `pod install`
- Open: `open ./web3swiftExample.xcworkspace`
